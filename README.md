## This README.md file serves the purpose of describing my project for week's 4 exercise in computer science.
### nnXprmntl is the name I gave to my master branch in the online platform of GitHub.
### nnXprmntl stands for non-experimental repository as I created some experimental repositories before to get a grip of how git works.

### EX4AMPRA
### The name stands for EXercise 4 AMPRA (4 for the week 4 followed by my name)
### In the repository named "EX4AMPRA" you will see an old exercise I solved some time ago, for this module.
### The exercise required I find the area of a circle with the radius using python coding language.

### SCREENSHOT provided of GitBash coding
### Now I will describe step by step how I created the "EX4AMPRA"
### 1. I used command "cd" which changes directory to get to the folder where I save all my Edunation work.
### 2. I used command "mkdir" to create a new folder in which I saved this specific exercise and then changed directory again to get into this folder.
### 3. I used command "git init" to initialize a repository in which I saved the exercise and later on pushed to the online GitHub platform.
### 4. I used command "git add" followed by the name of the file I wanted to move into my local repository.
### 5. I used command "git status" to double check in which stage I was with my code with the changes I had just made.
### 6. I used command "git commit" followed by a hyphen with the attached letter "m"
### This allowed me to save all the changes I had just made permanently and also leave a message so a possible reader can tell what was just done.
### 7. I used command "git status" once more to double check that my commit was executed properly.
### At this point I created the online repository in GitHub named "nnXprmntl" to later push my local repository online.
### This had some instructions on how to push a local repository in GitHub online
### 8. I used command "git remote add origin" followed by the link that was provided by the instruction on the "nnXprmntl" repository.
### 9. And last I used command "git push -u origin" to push my local repository online.
### I was then directed to a page online which asked for permission to push the local repository.
### Local repository pushed online successfully.
### Thank you(:
